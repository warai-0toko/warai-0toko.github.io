* I am currently a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu). I am working at the [DATA Lab](http://people.tamu.edu/~guangzhou92/Data_Lab/) under the supervision of [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html). 

* Previously, I spent six wonderful years in [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). 
I am extremely fortunate to have worked with collaborators Kaisiyuan Wang, Yun Zhu, Hansong Meng, Han Zhang and many more.

* Before joining Computer Sicence Department at TAMU, I studied the control theory, with focus on Kalman Filter and its applications at the low-level control system (motor control).

* My research interests lie in the general area of data mining and machine learning, particularly in automated machine learning.

=====
**Oct. 2020:** A paper about Automated Data Augmentation will come out soon.

**Sep. 2020:** Publish “Detecting Interactions from Neural Networks via Topological Analysis”  @ [Neurips 2020](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020) (To appear). –a new interaction detection algorithm from analyzing connections in neural networks. It tries to demystify how DNN learns feature interactions. It has nice therectical properties and some applications on finding useful crossing features.

**Jun. 2020:** Have a paper under review at [Neurips 2020](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020)
